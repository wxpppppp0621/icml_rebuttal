  This document presents a visual comparison between our method and two baselines: *Holodeck* and *InstructScene*. 

* **rgb_input_result.pdf**

  Contains additional qualitative results of our method given **RGB images as input**.

  Each example includes:

  * An input RGB image
  * The  corresponding 3D scene generated by our method

* **sketch_input_result.pdf**

  Contains additional qualitative results of our method given **hand-drawn sketches as input**.

  Each example includes:

  * An input sketch
